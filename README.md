# A Dot's Life
GETTING STARTED  https://pao2721.github.io/Pet-Sim/<br> 
A pet simulator where you manage a dot's hunger and happiness. I chose this game because I used to enjoy playing the tamagotchi games as a kid. Also the concept interested me more than the others.

INSTRUCTIONS<br>
The game is played by feeding, playing with, and ignoring Don Dotmarco to manipulate the happiness and hunger meters. You win by getting the hunger to level 4 and happiness to level 6 at the same time. You lose if either one hits level 0.

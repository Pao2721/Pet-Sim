# A Dot's Life
GETTING STARTED
A pet simulator where you manage a dot's hunger and happiness. I chose this game because I used to enjoy playing the tamagotchi games as a kid. Also the concept interested me more than the others.

INSTRUCTIONS
The game is played by feeding and playing a minigame to manipulate the happiness and hunger meters.You win by getting the hunger to level 4 and happiness to level 6 at the same time. You lose if either one hits level 0.
